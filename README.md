# PREDICTING-FACTORS-INFLUENCING-STUDENT-ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE-USING-ML

Summary of this project:
The project develops a model which predicts student academic performance based on external factors. This project involves crucial steps such as data collection, data 
preprocessing, feature extraction using one-hot encoding, model training, and testing. The model training phase involves using three classifiers: logistic regression, random forest classifiers, and support vector machine classifier with linear and RBF kernels. The hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the modelâ€™s predictive capability. Later, while testing the model, the evaluation metrics are calculated, and the best model is identified. 
For sample data, predictions were made using the best model, and the results are convincing and accurate. The entire process is designed to identify the factors that are influencing student success, which will allow stakeholders and educators to identify potential areas for intervention and support.

Potential Impact:
The predictive model developed in the project aims to help educational institutions identify students at risk of academic failure. The traditional strategies of 
modern education often ignore these external factors, so with the help of the SVM with linear kernel model developed in this project, with good accuracy, helps the stakeholders and educational institutions identify the students in need of support, and this leads to change in their strategies by introducing personalized learning strategies and individual counseling. Furthermore, educators can use the insights of this project to design more targeted interventions and address the challenges faced by the students. This project has 24 the potential to transform educational practices and procedures, particularly through the integration of machine learning techniques.
