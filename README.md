# Key Classifiers: 
1. Logistic Regression
Logistic regression proves to be a powerful, statistically valuable method for classification tasks. It is designed to handle discrete outcomes and employs a logistic function to transform the raw data into probabilities. The logistic function produces the predicted outcomes within the range of 0 to 1, contributing to interpreting these outcomes as probabilities. The main reason behind logic regression, as one of the key concepts for this project, is its adaptability in hyperparameter tuning. By adjusting hyperparameters through the iterative process in the code, logistic regression adapts to the intricacies of the dataset, enhancing its generalization capabilities. Beyond its classification ability, logistic regression delivers accurate predictions and profoundly explains the factors influencing student success.

2. Random Forest Classifier
Random forest classifier excels in predicting outcomes within a classification framework. Built on the foundation of ensemble learning, this method leverages the collective intelligence of multiple decision trees to deliver accurate predictions. This algorithm can deal with complex data and identify patterns, making it a key concept in the predictive modeling process. The random forest classifier offers a solution to the issue of overfitting by merging the predictions made by trees, which ultimately leads to a dependable model. It becomes crucial to optimize hyperparameters to improve their performance.

3. Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines(SVM) is a versatile ML algorithm utilized for both linear and non-linear data. SVM with multiple kernels ensures adaptability to the inherent characteristics of the dataset. The nature of SVM classifiers helps address various complexities in classification tasks. In the context of this project, SVM is a crucial concept with two kernels: linear and radial basis function(RBF) utilized. The linear kernel is employed to create an SVM model with a linear decision boundary and is efficient. At the same time, the RBF kernel is used when the relationships within the data are non-linear and complex. Combining these two linear and RBF kernels provides a more comprehensive modeling approach. The dual-kernel SVM approach helps in predicting more accurate outcomes predictions.

# Summary of this project:
The project develops a model that predicts student academic performance based on external factors. This project involves crucial steps such as data collection, data 
preprocessing, feature extraction using one-hot encoding, model training, and testing. The model training phase involves using three classifiers: logistic regression, random forest classifiers, and support vector machine classifiers with linear and RBF kernels. The hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the modelâ€™s predictive capability. Later, while testing the model, the evaluation metrics are calculated, and the best model is identified. 
For sample data, predictions were made using the best model, and the results are convincing and accurate. The entire process is designed to identify the factors that are influencing student success, which will allow stakeholders and educators to identify potential areas for intervention and support.

# Potential Impact:
The predictive model developed in the project aims to help educational institutions identify students at risk of academic failure. The traditional strategies of 
modern education often ignore these external factors, so with the help of the SVM with linear kernel model developed in this project, with good accuracy, helps the stakeholders and educational institutions identify the students in need of support, and this leads to change in their strategies by introducing personalized learning strategies and individual counseling. Furthermore, educators can use the insights of this project to design more targeted interventions and address the challenges faced by the students. This project has 24 the potential to transform educational practices and procedures, particularly through the integration of machine learning techniques.
